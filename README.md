# Steam-Winter-Sale-90s❄️

Welcome to Steam Winter Sale - 90s Edition, a retro-themed holiday website created for the [Codedex Mini Holiday Hackathon!](https://www.codedex.io/holiday-hackathon) 🎄✨ This is my very first attempt at building a website, and I’m excited to share it with you.

## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a nostalgic recreation of a 90s-style website, inspired by the Steam Winter Sale. It features:
- A retro design with vibrant colors, marquee text, and blinking Christmas lights.
- A snowfall effect created using JavaScript.
- A selection of classic games with discounts, styled in a 90s aesthetic.
- Background music to enhance the holiday spirit.
The goal of this project was to combine the charm of 90s web design with the excitement of a holiday sale, all while learning the basics of web development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure of the website.
- CSS: For styling and animations (e.g., blinking lights, glowing effects).
- JavaScript: For dynamic effects like the snowfall animation.
- GitHub: To host and share the project.

## 🎮 Features
- Retro Design: A fun and nostalgic 90s aesthetic with marquee text, Comic Sans font, and bright colors.
- Snowfall Animation: A JavaScript-powered snowfall effect to set the holiday mood.
- Game Discounts: A showcase of classic games with discounts, complete with "Buy Now" buttons.
- Background Music: A looping Christmas lo-fi track to enhance the festive atmosphere.
