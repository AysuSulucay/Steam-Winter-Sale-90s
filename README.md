## Challenges I Face While Creating My 90s Vibe Steam Winter Sale Website

Let me take you on a journey through my rollercoaster of emotions, and a newfound love-hate relationship with web development. Spoiler alert: CSS and I are no longer on speaking terms.

### 1. HTML: The "Oh, this isn't so bad" phase

When I first started with HTML I thought, "Hey this is easy Just slap some tags here and there, and voilà, a website" Little did I know, this was just the calm before the storm. Sure, I could throw in some <div>s and <img>s, but as soon as I tried to organize things, I realized I was building a house of cards. One wrong move, and everything collapsed into chaos. But hey, at least I could see something on the screen, so I gave myself a pat on the back.

### 2. CSS: The "Why does this hate me?" phase

Oh, CSS. My nemesis. My frenemy. My personal tormentor.

I went into this thinking, "How hard can it be to make things look pretty?" Turns out, very hard. 😭 Trying to position game visuals, buttons, and text properly felt like playing Tetris, except the pieces were on fire, and I was blindfolded. 

I spent hours tweaking margins and paddings, only to have everything look perfect on one screen size and completely broken on another. Fonts? Oh, don't even get me started. I tried to pick something that screamed "90s gaming nostalgia," but instead, I ended up screaming at my screen. By the end of it, my eyes were so numb from staring at CSS rules that I started dreaming in hex codes. #SendHelp.


### 3. JavaScript: The "At least it's not CSS" phase

JavaScript was like that one friend who shows up late to the party but doesn’t cause too much trouble. I didn’t do much with it, but when I did, it was a mix of "Wow, this is cool!" and "Wait, why isn’t this working?" I managed to add some basic interactivity, but since I was already emotionally drained from my CSS battles, I didn’t dive too deep. Let’s just say JavaScript and I are on neutral terms for now.

### 4. The Emotional Journey

This hackathon was my first time coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and let me tell you, it was like being thrown into the deep end of the pool without knowing how to swim. But despite the frustration, the late two nights, and the occasional existential crisis, I learned so much. I now have a newfound respect for web developers who make this look easy 🙏

And honestly? Even though CSS numbed my eyes and HTML made me question my life choices, I’m proud of what I created. It might not be perfect, but it’s mine. Plus, I think I captured that 90s vibe pretty well—complete with pixelated fonts and a layout that screams "retro chaos."

### Final Thoughts

In the end, this hackathon was like a crash course in web development, sprinkled with a healthy dose of nostalgia and a pinch of madness. I may have started as a complete newbie, but I came out of it with a website, a lot of lessons learned, and a slightly bruised ego 🙈 And who knows? Maybe one day, CSS and I will reconcile. But for now, I’m keeping my distance 😓
