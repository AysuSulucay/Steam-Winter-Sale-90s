# Steam-Winter-Sale-90s❄️

Welcome to Steam Winter Sale - 90s Edition, a retro-themed holiday website created for the [Codedex Mini Holiday Hackathon!](https://www.codedex.io/holiday-hackathon) 🎄✨ This is my very first attempt at building a website, and I’m excited to share it with you.

## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a nostalgic recreation of a 90s-style website, inspired by the Steam Winter Sale. It features:
- A retro design with vibrant colors, marquee text, and blinking Christmas lights.
- A snowfall effect created using JavaScript.
- A selection of classic games with discounts, styled in a 90s aesthetic.
- Background music to enhance the holiday spirit.
The goal of this project was to combine the charm of 90s web design with the excitement of a holiday sale, all while learning the basics of web development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML: For the structure of the website.
- CSS: For styling and animations (e.g., blinking lights, glowing effects).
- JavaScript: For dynamic effects like the snowfall animation.

## 🎮 Features
